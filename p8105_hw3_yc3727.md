### Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and `r ncol(instacart)` columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by users. There are
user/order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour.
There are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some
numeric codes.

#### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

It seems like the top 3 aisles where the most items are ordered from are
“fresh vegetables”, “fresh fruits”, and “packaged vegetable fruits”.

#### MMake a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) 
```

#### Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank < 4) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

#### Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

### Problem 2

#### Your final dataset should include all originally observed variables and values; have useful variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv("./Data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_to = "minutes", 
    names_prefix = "activity_", 
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(minutes = as.numeric(minutes), 
         day_num = recode(day, "Monday" = "1", 
                             "Tuesday" = "2", 
                             "Wednesday" = "3", 
                             "Thursday" = "4", 
                             "Friday" = "5", 
                             "Saturday" = "6", 
                             "Sunday" = "7")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    weekday_vs_weekend = case_when(
      day_num <=5 ~ "Weekday", 
      day_num > 5 ~ "Weekend", 
      TRUE ~ ""
    )
  ) %>%
  
  select(-day_num)
```

    ## 
    ## -- Column specification -------------------------------------------------
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )
    ## i Use `spec()` for the full column specifications.

The accelarator dataset contains information regarding the following
variables: activity\_count, day, day\_id, minutes, week,
weekday\_vs\_weekend. There are a total of 50400 row and 6 columns in
the final dataset.

#### Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accel_df %>%
  group_by(week, day_id) %>%
  summarize(
    total_activity = sum(activity_count)
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

| week | day\_id | total\_activity |
| ---: | ------: | --------------: |
|    1 |       1 |       480542.62 |
|    1 |       2 |        78828.07 |

|    3 |      15 |       467420.00 |
|    3 |      16 |       685910.00 |

|    4 |      25 |       260617.00 |
|    4 |      26 |       340291.00 |
|    4 |      27 |       319568.00 |
|    4 |      28 |       434460.00 |
|    5 |      29 |       620860.00 |

|    5 |      32 |       138421.00 |
|    5 |      33 |       549658.00 |
|    5 |      34 |       367824.00 |
|    5 |      35 |       445366.00 |

The patient seems to be most active on Fridays and the least active on
Saturdays.

#### Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.

``` r
accel_df %>%
ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = activity_count, color = day)) +
  geom_line()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_yc3727_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

Based on the graph, it seems like the patient is more active during the
day on Sundays and more active in the evening on Fridays. A noticeable
trend is that the time at which the patient is more active seems to
depend on which day of the week it is.

### Problem 3

#### Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall are given in reasonable units.

``` r
data(na_noaa)
```

    ## Warning in data(na_noaa): data set 'na_noaa' not found

``` r
ny_noaa_df = ny_noaa %>%
          separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>%
        mutate(
          year = factor(year), 
          month = as.integer(month), 
          day = as.integer(day),
          prcp = as.numeric(prcp),
          tmax = as.numeric(tmax), 
          tmin = as.numeric(tmin), 
          prcp = prcp/10, 
          tmax = tmax/10, 
          tmin = tmin/10
        ) 
```

#### For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?

``` r
snow_df = ny_noaa_df %>%
          count(snow) %>%
          arrange(desc(n))

head(snow_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 2
    ##    snow       n
    ##   <int>   <int>
    ## 1     0 2008508
    ## 2    NA  381221
    ## 3    25   31022
    ## 4    13   23095
    ## 5    51   18274
    ## 6    76   10173

It seems like the most commonly observed values was 0 when we count the
observations of the snow variable and arrange it in a descending order.

#### Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years. Is there any observable / interpretable structure? Any outliers?

``` r
ny_noaa_df %>%
  filter(month %in% c("1", "7")) %>%
  group_by(id, year, month) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_tmax, group = id, color = month))+
  geom_point(alpha = .5, size = .5) + 
  geom_path() + 
  facet_grid(.~month) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = .5, hjust =1))
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'id', 'year' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## Warning: Removed 5970 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

    ## Warning: Removed 5931 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).

<img src="p8105_hw3_yc3727_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
head(ny_noaa_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 9
    ##   id          year  month   day  prcp  snow  snwd  tmax  tmin
    ##   <chr>       <fct> <int> <int> <dbl> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 US1NYAB0001 2007     11     1    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA
    ## 2 US1NYAB0001 2007     11     2    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA
    ## 3 US1NYAB0001 2007     11     3    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA
    ## 4 US1NYAB0001 2007     11     4    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA
    ## 5 US1NYAB0001 2007     11     5    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA
    ## 6 US1NYAB0001 2007     11     6    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA

It seems like the average maximum temperature is generally much higher
in July than in January over all the weather stations, which makes sense
as they are in different seasons. There seems to be outliers in January
of 1982 and July of 1988.

#### Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset (note that a scatterplot may not be the best option). (ii) Make a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less than 100 separately by year.;

``` r
tmax_tmin = ny_noaa_df %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(tmax), y = as.numeric(tmin))) +
            geom_hex() + 
            labs(
              x = "Maximum temperature (C)", 
              y = "Minimum temperature (C)"
            )+ 
            theme(legend.position = "none")

snow_dist = ny_noaa_df %>%
            filter(snow > 0 & snow <100) %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = year, y = snow, color = year)) + 
            geom_violin(alpha = .5) + 
            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = .5, hjust = 1)) + 
            theme(legend.position = "none") + 
            labs(
              x = "Year", 
              y = "Snowfall (mm)"
            )

tmax_tmin + snow_dist 
```

    ## Warning: Removed 1136276 rows containing non-finite values (stat_binhex).
